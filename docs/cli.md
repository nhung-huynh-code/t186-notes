The ls command is used to list the contents of a directory, showing files and subdirectories. With options like -l (long format) and -a (including hidden files), it provides more detailed views.

The cat command displays the contents of a file, concatenates files, or creates new ones. Itâ€™s commonly used to view file content or merge multiple files, like cat file1.txt file2.txt > combined.txt.
